I am a relatively recent convert to Tabletop Role Playing Games (ttrpgs), but in the past couple years they have come to play a pretty important role in my life, giving me a chance to socialize and also to indulge my creative side. This is especially true while under quarantine conditions. Ttrpgs are easy to play with friends virtually, much easier than the board and card games that my friends used to play.

The thing no one tells you about ttrpgs is that, despite the fantastic trappings, they are really games of math and memorization. The second problem is especially present when playing a class that can cast spells, as each spell has specific rules about when and how to cast it, and what exactly it does. The biggest friction point in any ttrpg session is when the caster needs to flip through their sourcebooks to find the wordings to the particular spell they want to cast. 

Of course, there are apps out there already which streamline this process, and to which I am forever beholden (almost exclusively playing casters). When I discovered an API for the Basic Rules (freely available Dungeons and Dragons information), I knew that I wanted to impliment my own version. A future goal I have is to create tools, similar to DnD Beyond (the main app for Dungeons and Dragons 5e) for other ttrpg systems. Building a spellfinder for DnD felt like a good way to practice that.

The process itself wasn't too bad. Most of the methods I had to write were pretty basic, and fitting them together was easy. The biggest challenge I faced was coming up with the menuing loops, and keeping them from breaking in case of an uncooperative user. It forced me to use more until loops than I am used to, but it was nice to step beyond my comfort zone and play with tools I haven't used much before. 

This project was also my first time coding in a local environment, and that was a challenge. The installation was, of course, worse than actually learning how to use it, and for the first time in my life I questioned my preference for PC's over Macs. As a PC gamer that choice should be a no brainer, but the jealousy I felt hearing about Mac users' setup experience was pretty intense. Once it was working, though, it was nice and I wished I had made the switch to a local environment sooner. Losing 5 hours work on a project near the end of a unit was a scarring experience that I will hopefully never repeat.
