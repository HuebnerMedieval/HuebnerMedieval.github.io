Before coming to tech, I was a high school social studies teacher. Teaching is a complicated profession. Everyone thinks they know how it works, because everyone has been in a classroom before. Everyone has seen a teacher work, so we assume we know everything a teacher does. The thing is, classroom instruction, the front end of teacher, is less than half of a teacher's daily workload. While some teachers can get away with improvising and just doing whatever comes to mind in front of the room, in order to be successful most teachers put in as much time planning for each lesson as they do actually delivering the lesson! The best teachers put MORE time into planning than they do into actually instructing. Of course, teaching is a lot more than planning and instructing. There is grading, professional development, and endless meetings and paperword that also have to be completed behind the scenes to create a smoothly functioning classroom.

Coming from education, I understand the importance of proper planning. In order to create a quality product, you have to know what that product should do, how to actually build it, and then how to assess whether it worked as intended. If it didn't, that means the lesson has to be reworked and tried again. In education, this process is called Understanding by Design. It also happens to be more or less the same as the same as the product development lifecycle in the Scrum methodology, although Scrum offers more built in collaboration than teaching often does.

So far, it may seem like I am rambling, but I promise there is a point. One of the biggest challenges in teaching is that planning stage, identifying what a lesson needs to do, and then designing something to achieve that goal. Often in teaching, as in any product development, developers get lost in creating something "cool" without considering whether it actually does what it was intended to do. You can make the best looking, coolest program in the world, but the client likely won't accept it if it doesn't do what they asked.

It is no secret that teachers operate with far fewer resources than they need. One thing teachers are really missing is a clear and standardized way to organize learning objectives, and to keep them ever present as they design their lessons. I created a web app, using Sinatra, which does just that. It allows teachers to create and store lessons, with the learning objectives given center stage so that the goal can always be kept in mind. Of course, the design process was made much easier with clear goals in mind! Working on this project really brought home just how similar curriculum design and software development are.
